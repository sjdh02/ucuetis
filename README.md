# Discontinued
This project was a great start for my first shot at making a compiler, and I learned a lot of things along the way. Unfortunately,
going back and retro-fitting a lot of the better ideas I've had would be more work than actually just rewriting the whole thing.
Not to mention I also want to change the syntax to something more standard.
